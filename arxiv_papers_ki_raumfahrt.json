    "title": "Remarks on Talagrand's deviation inequality for Rademacher functions",
    "summary": "Recently Talagrand [T] estimated the deviation of a function on $\\{0,1\\}^n$\nfrom its median in terms of the Lipschitz constant of a convex extension of $f$\nto $\\ell ^n_2$; namely, he proved that\n  $$P(|f-M_f| > c) \\le 4 e^{-t^2/4\\sigma ^2}$$ where $\\sigma$ is the Lipschitz\nconstant of the extension of $f$ and $P$ is the natural probability on\n$\\{0,1\\}^n$.\n  Here we extend this inequality to more general product probability spaces; in\nparticular, we prove the same inequality for $\\{0,1\\}^n$ with the product\nmeasure $((1-\\eta)\\delta _0 + \\eta \\delta _1)^n$. We believe this should be\nuseful in proofs involving random selections. As an illustration of possible\napplications we give a simple proof (though not with the right dependence on\n$\\varepsilon$) of the Bourgain, Lindenstrauss, Milman result [BLM] that for\n$1\\le r < s \\le 2$ and $\\varepsilon >0$, every $n$-dimensional subspace of $L_s\n\\ (1+\\varepsilon)$-embeds into $\\ell ^N_r$ with $N = c(r,s,\\varepsilon)n$.",

    "summary": "We give an elementary proof that the $H^p$ spaces over the unit disc (or the\nupper half plane) are the interpolation spaces for the real method of\ninterpolation between $H^1$ and $H^\\infty$. This was originally proved by Peter\nJones. The proof uses only the boundedness of the Hilbert transform and the\nclassical factorisation of a function in $H^p$ as a product of two functions in\n$H^q$ and $H^r$ with $1/q+1/r=1/p$. This proof extends without any real extra\ndifficulty to the non-commutative setting and to several Banach space valued\nextensions of $H^p$ spaces. In particular, this proof easily extends to the\ncouple $H^{p_0}(\\ell_{q_0}),H^{p_1}(\\ell_{q_1})$, with $1\\leq p_0, p_1, q_0,\nq_1 \\leq \\infty$. In that situation, we prove that the real interpolation\nspaces and the K-functional are induced ( up to equivalence of norms ) by the\nsame objects for the couple $L_{p_0}(\\ell_{q_0}), L_{p_1}(\\ell_{q_1})$. In\nanother direction, let us denote by $C_p$ the space of all compact operators\n$x$ on Hilbert space such that $tr(|x|^p) <\\infty$. Let $T_p$ be the subspace\nof all upper triangular matrices relative to the canonical basis. If\n$p=\\infty$, $C_p$ is just the space of all compact operators. Our proof allows\nus to show for instance that the space $H^p(C_p)$ (resp. $T_p$) is the\ninterpolation space of parameter $(1/p,p)$ between $H^1(C_1)$ (resp. $T_1$) and\n$H^\\infty(C_\\infty)$ (resp. $T_\\i$). We also prove a similar result for the\ncomplex interpolation method. Moreover, extending a recent result of\nKaftal-Larson and Weiss, we prove that the distance to the subspace of upper\ntriangular matrices in $C_1$ and $C_\\infty$ can be essentially realized\nsimultaneously by the same element.",

    "summary": "We compute the $S$-matrix of the Tricritical Ising Model perturbed by the\nsubleading magnetic operator using Smirnov's RSOS reduction of the\nIzergin-Korepin model. The massive model contains kink excitations which\ninterpolate between two degenerate asymmetric vacua. As a consequence of the\ndifferent structure of the two vacua, the crossing symmetry is implemented in a\nnon-trivial way. We use finite-size techniques to compare our results with the\nnumerical data obtained by the Truncated Conformal Space Approach and find good\nagreement.",

    "summary": "We show that tree level ``resonant'' $N$ tachyon scattering amplitudes, which\ndefine a sensible ``bulk'' S -- matrix in critical (super) string theory in any\ndimension, have a simple structure in two dimensional space time, due to\npartial decoupling of a certain infinite set of discrete states. We also argue\nthat the general (non resonant) amplitudes are determined by the resonant ones,\nand calculate them explicitly, finding an interesting analytic structure.\nFinally, we discuss the space time interpretation of our results.",
